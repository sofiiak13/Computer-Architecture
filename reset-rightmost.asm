; This skeleton of an assembly-language program is provided to help you
; begin with the programming task for A#1, part (b). In this and other
; files provided through the semester, you will see lines of code
; indicating "DO NOT TOUCH" sections. You are *not* to modify the
; lines within these sections. The only exceptions are for specific
; changes announced on conneX or in written permission from the course
; instructor. *** Unapproved changes could result in incorrect code
; execution during assignment evaluation, along with an assignment grade
; of zero. ****
;
; In a more positive vein, you are expected to place your code with the
; area marked "STUDENT CODE" sections.

; ==== BEGINNING OF "DO NOT TOUCH" SECTION ====
; Your task: You are to take the bit sequence stored in R16,
; and to reset the rightmost contiguous sequence of set
; by storing this new value in R25. For example, given
; the bit sequence 0b01011100, resetting the right-most
; contigous sequence of set bits will produce 0b01000000.
; As another example, given the bit sequence 0b10110110,
; the result will be 0b10110000.
;
; Your solution must work, of course, for bit sequences other
; than those provided in the example. (How does your
; algorithm handle a value with no set bits? with all set bits?)

; ANY SIGNIFICANT IDEAS YOU FIND ON THE WEB THAT HAVE HELPED
; YOU DEVELOP YOUR SOLUTION MUST BE CITED AS A COMMENT (THAT
; IS, WHAT THE IDEA IS, PLUS THE URL).
